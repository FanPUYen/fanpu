== Research

Cong Ling's research covers coding and information theory, post-quantum cryptography, communications, and signal processing, with an emphasis on lattices and their applications. Lattices, which generalize the concept of integers to multiple dimensions, are central objects in modern number theory and have numerous applications in information theory, sphere packing, wireless communications, and post-quantum cryptography.

Our research lies at the interface of information theory, number theory, cryptography, and quantum information.
